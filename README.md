interact with bots by sending them messages, commands, and
inline requests.

This bot is designed to give a ‘response’ to the ‘request’ of the user.
1. This is a News-bot, which will show the user the News on a
user-specific topic of a user-specific geographical area in a
user-specific language, based on the user’s choice
Eg., If a user asks the bot: “show me Business news
from India in Hindi”, then the user will get the appropriate
news (topic=“BusinessNews”, location=“India”,
language=“Hindi”) from the bot in response.
2. This bot can also engage in Smalltalk, i.e., it can also give
responses to general questions like, “How are you?”, “How is
